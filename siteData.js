      "description": "As a member of the Hartford Fashion Week team from 2015-2019 I provided Graphic and Web services: everything from front-end design to back-end server management.\n\nI focus on a grunge aesthetic for the event postcards in an allusion to the raw grit of our efforts to create a new tradition on our city.\n\nThe logo needed some slight tweaks to enhance the consistency of the letter forms.\n\nThe event guide is a multi-page full-color booklet suitable for slipping into a pocket or purse. Building on the logo's theme of a thread or ribbon, the guide is crafted with a series of interweaving color bands. These represent the diversity of designs found on our runway. All brightly colored, this pop design draws in the eyes for a feast of visual candy.\n\nThe website design builds on this same theme of garment elements. The main menu borrows from the practice of quilting, or using eclectic textiles arranged in a grid. Important headings are presented like printed, wrapped ribbons around the main content. The thread of the logo emerges from behind the folded corner of the web \"page.\""

Continuing the collab with my alternate identity HTMLCSS.TEZ\n\nThe practice of layering many graphic shapes and gradients with a chaotic mix of blending modes has been with me since my first years of photoshop in my youth. It's a familiar, friendly technique. Yet, I've rarely played with it outside photoshop. Here I take the opportunity to apply this abstract blending technique in a manner that alludes to reality: refracting crystals.\n\nThese generated crystals are not based in fact but imagination. They are illustrative of the magic and wonder some people associate with real life minerals and rocks. They blend together with impossible color changes only possible in the virtual."

There is a limited amount of javascript to construct the scene and facilitate interactive controls. � <canvas>!\n\nA bit of history about this approach: As my first coding language HTML and CSS holds a special place in my heart. Even when I jumped into 3D my first creations were made with just some html + css coded in notepad. Earlier this year I took this idea to the next level with a yet-to-be-released 3D bedrooms project, filling it with objects and ever-refining my scene construction practice. This system for scene construction became the basis for a few other generative projects here on fxhash under my pseudonym htmlcss.tez. Here I abandon my usual representational focus with this technique and dive right into the abstract."

Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey!\n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?"
